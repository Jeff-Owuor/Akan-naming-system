# GHANIAN CULTURE:AKAN NAMING
In this particular project the user is required to input the day he/she was born and the gender then assigned an akan name. The akan naming system works as such:
  - If the day entered is Sunday then the male akan name will be Kwasi while the female akan name will be Akosua.
  - If the day entered is Monday then the male akan name will be Kwadwo while the female one will be Adwoa.
  - If the day entered is Tuesday then the male akan name will be Kwabena while the female one will be Abenaa.
  - If the day entered is Wednesday then the male akan name will be Kwaku while the female one will be Akua.
  - If the day entered is Thursday then the male akan name will be Yaw while the female one will be Yaa.
  - If the day entered is Friday then the male akan name will be Kofi while the female one will be Afua.
  - If the day entered is Saturday the male akan name will be Kwame while the female one will be Ama.
###   Setup instructions
Add three files with .html, .css and .js extensions. Create the form using html and center it with css. Grab the elements using the DOM and add a submit event handler to the form and a click event handler to the button. In the submit event handler prevent the default submit behaviour and call the function that validates the user input. In the click event handler call a function that alerts the user the akan name according to the input entered.

| Correct day of the week  | Sunday   | valid input  |
